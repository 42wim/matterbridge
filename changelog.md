# v1.21.0

## Breaking Changes

- discord: Remove WebhookURL support (discord) (#1323)

`WebhookURL` global setting for discord is removed and will quit matterbridge.
New `AutoWebhooks=true` setting, which will automatically use (and create, if they do not exist) webhooks inside specific channels. This only works if the bot has Manage Webhooks permission in bridged channels (global permission or as a channel permission override). Backwards compatibility with channel-specific webhooks. More info [here](https://github.com/42wim/matterbridge/blob/master/matterbridge.toml.sample#L862).

# v1.20.0

## Breaking

- matrix: Send the display name instead of the user name (matrix) (#1282)  
  Matrix now sends the displayname if set instead of the username. If you want to keep the username, add  `UseUsername=true` to your matrix config. <https://github.com/42wim/matterbridge/wiki/Settings#useusername-1>
- discord: Disable webhook editing (discord) (#1296)  
  Because of issues with ratelimiting of webhook editing, this feature is now disabled. If you have multiple discord channels you bridge, you'll need to add a `webhookURL` to the `[gateway.inout.options]`. See <https://github.com/42wim/matterbridge/blob/master/matterbridge.toml.sample#L1864-L1870> for an example.

## Breaking changes
The slack bridge has been split in a `slack-legacy` and `slack` bridge.
If you're still using `legacy tokens` and want to keep using them you'll have to rename `slack` to `slack-legacy` in your configuration. See [wiki](https://github.com/42wim/matterbridge/wiki/Section-Slack-(basic)#legacy-configuration) for more information.

To migrate to the new bot-token based setup you can follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/42wim/matterbridge/wiki/Slack-bot-setup).

Slack legacy tokens may be deprecated by Slack at short notice, so it is STRONGLY recommended to use a proper bot-token instead.

## New features
* general: New {GATEWAY} variable for `RemoteNickFormat` #501. See `RemoteNickFormat` in matterbridge.toml.sample.
* general: New {CHANNEL} variable for `RemoteNickFormat` #515. See `RemoteNickFormat` in matterbridge.toml.sample.
* general: Remove hyphens when auto-loading envvars from viper config #545
* discord: You can mention discord-users from other bridges.
* slack: Preserve threading between Slack instances #529. See `PreserveThreading` in matterbridge.toml.sample.
* slack: Add ability to show when user is typing across Slack bridges #559
* slack: Add rate-limiting
* mattermost: Add support for mattermost [matterbridge plugin](https://github.com/matterbridge/mattermost-plugin)
* api: Respond with message on connect. #550
* api: Add a health endpoint to API #554

## Bugfix
* slack: Refactoring and making it better.
* slack: Restore file comments coming from Slack. #583
* irc: Fix IRC line splitting. #587
* mattermost: Fix cookie and personal token behaviour. #530
* mattermost: Check for expiring sessions and reconnect.
