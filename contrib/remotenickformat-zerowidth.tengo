This script will return the nick except with multi-character usernames
containing a zero-width space between the first and second character letter.

Single character usernames will be left untouched.

This is useful to prevent remote users from nickalerting
IRC users of the same name when the remote user speaks.

This result can be used in {TENGO} in RemoteNickFormat.
