## Features

- Focuses on simplicity, yet tries to still be flexible.
- Only requires [standard library packages](https://godoc.org/github.com/lrstanley/girc?imports)
- Event based triggering/responses ([example](https://godoc.org/github.com/lrstanley/girc#ex-package--Commands), and [CTCP too](https://godoc.org/github.com/lrstanley/girc#Commands.SendCTCP)!)
- [Documentation](https://godoc.org/github.com/lrstanley/girc) is _mostly_ complete.
- Support for a good portion of the [IRCv3 spec](http://ircv3.net/software/libraries.html).
  - SASL Auth (currently only `PLAIN` and `EXTERNAL` is support by default,
  however you can simply implement `SASLMech` yourself to support additional
  mechanisms.)
  - Message tags (things like `account-tag` on by default)
  - `account-notify`, `away-notify`, `chghost`, `extended-join`, etc -- all handled seemlessly ([cap.go](https://github.com/lrstanley/girc/blob/master/cap.go) for more info).
- Channel and user tracking. Easily find what users are in a channel, if a
  user is away, or if they are authenticated (if the server supports it!)
- Client state/capability tracking. Easy methods to access capability data ([LookupChannel](https://godoc.org/github.com/lrstanley/girc#Client.LookupChannel), [LookupUser](https://godoc.org/github.com/lrstanley/girc#Client.LookupUser), [GetServerOption (ISUPPORT)](https://godoc.org/github.com/lrstanley/girc#Client.GetServerOption), etc.)
- Built-in support for things you would commonly have to implement yourself.
  - Nick collision detection and prevention (also see [Config.HandleNickCollide](https://godoc.org/github.com/lrstanley/girc#Config).)
  - Event/message rate limiting.
  - Channel, nick, and user validation methods ([IsValidChannel](https://godoc.org/github.com/lrstanley/girc#IsValidChannel), [IsValidNick](https://godoc.org/github.com/lrstanley/girc#IsValidNick), etc.)
  - CTCP handling and auto-responses ([CTCP](https://godoc.org/github.com/lrstanley/girc#CTCP))
  - And more!
