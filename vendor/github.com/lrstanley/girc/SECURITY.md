# :old_key: Security Policy

## :heavy_check_mark: Supported Versions

The following restrictions apply for versions that are still supported in terms of security and bug fixes:

   * :grey_question: Must be using the latest major/minor version.
   * :grey_question: Must be using a supported platform for the repository (e.g. OS, browser, etc), and that platform must
     be within its supported versions (for example: don't use a legacy or unsupported version of Ubuntu or
     Google Chrome).
   * :grey_question: Repository must not be archived (unless the vulnerability is critical, and the repository moderately
     popular).
   * :heavy_check_mark:

If one of the above doesn't apply to you, feel free to submit an issue and we can discuss the
issue/vulnerability further.


## :lady_beetle: Reporting a Vulnerability

Best method of contact: [GPG :key:](https://github.com/lrstanley.gpg)

   * :speech_balloon: [Discord][chat]: message `/home/liam#0000`.
   * :email: Email: `security@liamstanley.io`

Backup contacts (if I am unresponsive after **48h**): [GPG :key:](https://github.com/FM1337.gpg)
   * :speech_balloon: [Discord][chat]: message `Allen#7440`.
   * :email: Email: `security@allenlydiard.ca`

If you feel that this disclosure doesn't include a critical vulnerability and there is no sensitive
information in the disclosure, you don't have to use the GPG key. For all other situations, please
use it.

### :stopwatch: Vulnerability disclosure expectations

   * :no_bell: We expect you to not share this information with others, unless:
       * The maximum timeline for initial response has been exceeded (shown below).
       * The maximum resolution time has been exceeded (shown below).
   * :mag_right: We expect you to responsibly investigate this vulnerability -- please do not utilize the
     vulnerability beyond the initial findings.
   * :stopwatch: Initial response within 48h, however, if the primary contact shown above is unavailable, please
     use the backup contacts provided. The maximum timeline for an initial response should be within
     7 days.
   * :stopwatch: Depending on the severity of the disclosure, resolution time may be anywhere from 24h to 2
     weeks after initial response, though in most cases it will likely be closer to the former.
       * If the vulnerability is very low/low in terms of risk, the above timelines **will not apply**.
   * :toolbox: Before the release of resolved versions, a [GitHub Security Advisory][advisory-docs].
     will be released on the respective repository. [Browser all advisories here][advisory].
