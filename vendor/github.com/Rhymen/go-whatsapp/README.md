# go-whatsapp
Package rhymen/go-whatsapp implements the WhatsApp Web API to provide a clean interface for developers. Big thanks to all contributors of the [sigalor/whatsapp-web-reveng](https://github.com/sigalor/whatsapp-web-reveng) project. The official WhatsApp Business API was released in August 2018. You can check it out [here](https://www.whatsapp.com/business/api).

## Installation
```sh
go get github.com/Rhymen/go-whatsapp
```

## Usage
### Creating a connection
```go
import (
    whatsapp "github.com/Rhymen/go-whatsapp"
)

wac, err := whatsapp.NewConn(20 * time.Second)
```
The duration passed to the NewConn function is used to timeout login requests. If you have a bad internet connection use a higher timeout value. This function only creates a websocket connection, it does not handle authentication.

### Login
```go
qrChan := make(chan string)
go func() {
    fmt.Printf("qr code: %v\n", <-qrChan)
    //show qr code or save it somewhere to scan
}()
sess, err := wac.Login(qrChan)
```
The authentication process requires you to scan the qr code, that is send through the channel, with the device you are using whatsapp on. The session struct that is returned can be saved and used to restore the login without scanning the qr code again. The qr code has a ttl of 20 seconds and the login function throws a timeout err if the time has passed or any other request fails.

### Restore
```go
newSess, err := wac.RestoreWithSession(sess)
```
The restore function needs a valid session and returns the new session that was created.

### Add message handlers
```go
type myHandler struct{}

func (myHandler) HandleError(err error) {
	fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "%v", err)
}

func (myHandler) HandleTextMessage(message whatsapp.TextMessage) {
	fmt.Println(message)
}

func (myHandler) HandleImageMessage(message whatsapp.ImageMessage) {
	fmt.Println(message)
}

func (myHandler) HandleDocumentMessage(message whatsapp.DocumentMessage) {
	fmt.Println(message)
}

func (myHandler) HandleVideoMessage(message whatsapp.VideoMessage) {
	fmt.Println(message)
}

func (myHandler) HandleAudioMessage(message whatsapp.AudioMessage){	
	fmt.Println(message)
}

func (myHandler) HandleJsonMessage(message string) {
	fmt.Println(message)
}

func (myHandler) HandleContactMessage(message whatsapp.ContactMessage) {
	fmt.Println(message)
}

func (myHandler) HandleBatteryMessage(msg whatsapp.BatteryMessage) {
	fmt.Println(message)
}

func (myHandler) HandleNewContact(contact whatsapp.Contact) {
	fmt.Println(contact)
}

wac.AddHandler(myHandler{})
```
The message handlers are all optional, you don't need to implement anything but the error handler to implement the interface. The ImageMessage, VideoMessage, AudioMessage and DocumentMessage provide a Download function to get the media data.

### Sending text messages
```go
text := whatsapp.TextMessage{
    Info: whatsapp.MessageInfo{
        RemoteJid: "0123456789@s.whatsapp.net",
    },
    Text: "Hello Whatsapp",
}

err := wac.Send(text)
```

### Sending Contact Messages
```go
contactMessage := whatsapp.ContactMessage{
			Info: whatsapp.MessageInfo{ 
                RemoteJid: "0123456789@s.whatsapp.net", 
                },
			DisplayName: "Luke Skylwallker",
			Vcard: "BEGIN:VCARD\nVERSION:3.0\nN:Skyllwalker;Luke;;\nFN:Luke Skywallker\nitem1.TEL;waid=0123456789:+1 23 456789789\nitem1.X-ABLabel:Mobile\nEND:VCARD",
		}

id, error := client.WaConn.Send(contactMessage)
```


The message will be send over the websocket. The attributes seen above are the required ones. All other relevant attributes (id, timestamp, fromMe, status) are set if they are missing in the struct. For the time being we only support text messages, but other types are planned for the near future.
