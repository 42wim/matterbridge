# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The two most recent minor releases are supported, with older versions receiving updates subject to contributor discretion.
Please also report issues in master, but there are no guarantees of stability there.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

All vulnerability reports are welcomed. Use your discretion in providing information to Discussions, an Issue, or message a maintainer directly.
For a non-trivial issue, you should receive a response within a week, but more than likely a day or two.
