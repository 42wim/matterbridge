# DDP in Go

[Meteor](https://meteor.com) DDP library for Go. This library allows Go applications to connect to Meteor applications, subscribe to Meteor publications, read from a cached Collection (similar to minimongo), and call Meteor methods on the server.

See `ddp/_examples` for some tips and an example app that walks through all the features of the library.
