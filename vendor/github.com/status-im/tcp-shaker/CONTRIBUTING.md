## Styleguide
### Git commit message

- Capitalize the first letter ("Add feature" not "add feature")
- Limit the first line to 50 characters or less
- Details below the first line should be wrapped to 72 characters
- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")

Please squash your commits into a single commit when appropriate. This simplifies future cherry picks and keeps the git log clean.
