### waku/0

This namespace implements `waku` 0.6 as described in https://github.com/vacp2p/specs/blob/master/specs/waku/waku-0.md and it
is now deprecated. Now feature changes will be made only critical bugfixes if required.
Once support for `waku/0` can be dropped, this code can be safely removed.
